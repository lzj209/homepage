abstract: We participate in the DSTC9 Interactive Dialogue Evaluation Track
  (Gunasekara et al. 2020) sub-task 1 (Knowledge Grounded Dialogue) and sub-task
  2 (Interactive Dialogue). In sub-task 1, we employ a pre-trained language
  model to generate topic-related responses and propose a response ensemble
  method for response selection. In sub-task2, we propose a novel Dialogue
  Planning Model (DPM) to capture conversation flow in the interaction with
  humans. We also design an integrated open-domain dialogue system containing
  pre-process, dialogue model, scoring model, and post-process, which can
  generate fluent, coherent, consistent, and humanlike responses. We tie 1st on
  human ratings and also get the highest Meteor, and Bert-score in sub-task 1,
  and rank 3rd on interactive human evaluation in sub-task 2.
